# [Main](../#tutorial-exercises) => Istio Bookinfo Sample Application

#### In this exercise we will setup the sample Istio application which is a book review app. This example offers the opportunity to take some of Istio's cool features for a spin, like traffic routing.

#### The Google Kubernetes Engine install offers a checkbox install option; feel free to use it if you just want to get up and running. 


[BookInfo sample app overview](https://istio.io/docs/guides/bookinfo/)

* [Running on Kubernetes](https://istio.io/docs/guides/bookinfo/#running-on-kubernetes)

* [Running on Docker/Consul](https://istio.io/docs/guides/bookinfo/#running-on-docker-with-consul-or-eureka)

Once you've verified that the bookinfo app is up and running, fire some requests at it

```
$ curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage

```

Try some of the other built in features.

* Take a look at the Grafana [Istio Dashboard](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/using-istio-dashboard/) and see what metrics are available for monitoring Istio.

* Generate a [service graph](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/servicegraph/)

* Collect [metrics and logs](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/metrics-logs/)

* Query Metrics [from Prometheus](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/querying-metrics/)

* Look at request samples with [Distributed Tracing](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/distributed-tracing/)
